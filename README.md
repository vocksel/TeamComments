# TeamComments

TeamComments is a productivity tool for Roblox Studio that lets you and your
team leave floating messages around the Workspace that can be replied to in
threads.

Leaving comments floating in the environment brings a new way for you and your
team to communicate with each other about the world, or anything else you can
think of. For example, scripters can ask questions about how to connect what a
builder has made to the codebase, and builders can ask questions about design
ideas, or for feedback on what could be added somewhere. All with the added
context of _where_ these questions are relevant.

This is an early version and likely has many undiscovered bugs. Please submit
issues here on GitHub!
