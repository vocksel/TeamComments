# TeamComments

TeamComments is a productivity tool for Roblox Studio that lets you and your team leave floating messages around the Workspace that can be replied to in threads.

**This is an early version and likely has many undiscovered bugs. Please submit issues here on GitHub if you discover anything!**

## Motivation

Leaving comments floating in the environment brings a new way for you and your team to communicate with each other about the world. For example, scripters can ask questions about how to connect what a builder has made to the codebase, and builders can ask questions about design ideas or for feedback on what could be added somewhere. All with the added context of _where_ these questions are relevant, which has typically involved sending screenshots in team group chats.

## Installation
